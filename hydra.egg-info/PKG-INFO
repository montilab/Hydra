        Running the pipeline
        ====================
        
        
        **Pre-requisites**
        
        Hydra requires Java 1.6+. All other tools are wrapped in a Conda environment, see below. 
        
        
        *1. Get Conda*
        
        
        `conda` is available as part of the `miniconda package <http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html>`_.
        
        
        .. note::
        
           If you're using a module system such as on the shared computing cluster (SCC) at Boston University you can just load a preinstalled version:
        
           .. code:: bash
        
             module purge
             module load anaconda2/4.3.0
        
        *2. Set Environment and Build Paths*::
        
            export CONDA_ENVS_PATH=<WORKING_DIR>/conda-envs
            export CONDA_BLD_PATH=<WORKING_DIR>/conda-bld
        
        *3. Create Dev Environment*
        
        Use `conda` to install a basic developement environment::
          
          conda env create \
            montilab/dev_env \
            -p ./dev_env 
        
        This will create a `./dev_env folder that stores all the files needed to run the pipeline. For more details, please refer to the Developer's Guide. (LINK)
        
        *4. Install all necessary R packages*
        Activate the environment so you have access to the R version that the pipeline uses::
         
          source activate ./dev_env
        
        Start R::
        
          R
        
        Within R install all necessary packages::
        
            require(devtools)
            install_git("http://github.com/nachocab/clickme.git")
        
        Running the pipeline
        ====================
        
        Activate the environment (follow the instructions provided by conda following the environment's
        creation)::
         
          source activate ./dev_env
          
        Then you can run the pipeline, while providing your parameter file.
        
        Example::
        
           hydra-rnaseq -p param.txt
        
        
        A detailed description of the parameter file is provided `here <docs/user_docs/parameters.rst>`__ and an example is located here `here <parameters_example.txt>`__ .
        
        
        Additional documentation
        ========================
        
        A detailed user documentation is provided `here <docs/user_docs/index.rst>`__. For advanced users that are contributing to the development such as adding additional modules a documentation is provided `here <docs/dev_docs/index.rst>`__
